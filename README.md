 <!-- About section -->
 ---
👨🏽‍💻 I'm a Full-stack Developer, Designer and Advocate passionate about people, life-long learning, problem-solving, coding and creating innovative solutions using technology.

My ultimate goal in life is to inspire my generation while being part of a dynamic and innovative community where I will b able to contribute to its growth and, in the process, enhance my professional and personal growth as well!

I love sharing my multifaceted experiences & knowledge with others, and I do that through content creation on my <a href="https://medium.com/@muhammadidoniwako">Blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@muhd-dev">YouTube</a> channel. I was a photographer for almost a decade until I fell in love with tech, self-reinvention and life-long learning.


I began my coding journey in June 2023, and ever since, I've been deeply immersed in the world of programming. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me engrossed in self-help books, learning to improve on new languages (French & Arabic) and exploring the internet to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology.

- 😄 I identify as: Multifaceted, Versatile, Nerd   

- 💬 Ask me about: Tech, Self-reinvention, Content Creation.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My friends think my superpower is my ability to think critically, my resilience, perseverance, and exceptional listening skills. Public speaking is an area that I am also working and improving on to become a better communicator.
